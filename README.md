We propose potential applications of 5G technology in healthcare, a 5G-enabled emergency vehicle communication system, We propose a 5G-enabled emergency vehicle communication system that allows emergency vehicles to communicate with other vehicles, traffic management systems, roadside units (RSUs), and emergency services using 5G technology to provide emergency services faster and more efficiently. This system will use the high-speed and low latency 5G network to enable real-time communication and data transfer between emergency vehicles and other stakeholders. The system includes various components such as 5G-enabled radios, sensors, cameras, and GPS systems installed in roadside units and emergency vehicles. These components will gather real-time data on road and traffic conditions, weather, and potential hazards and transmit it to a centralized control center using the 5G network, which will analyze and distribute it to emergency vehicles, traffic management systems, and first responders. One of the key features of 5G technology is its ability to provide prioritized and dedicated network access for emergency services. By utilizing this feature, emergency vehicles can communicate without interruption or delay, even in high-traffic situations or areas with poor network coverage.
